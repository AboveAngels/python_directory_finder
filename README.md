# python_directory_finder
WiP -- Multi-Threaded Python-based Directory Finder

This software should be used only to test websites you own or are permitted to work on.
I created it to search for all directories off of a given "root" directory.
I am sure it is not the fastest tool out there or the sneakiest. 
Minimal effort was given to hiding the identity of the script past random user agents.
If you have a feature request open an issue and I will consider looking at implimenting it.
