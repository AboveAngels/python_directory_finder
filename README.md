# python_directory_finder
**WiP** -- Multi-Threaded Python-based Directory Finder
### _Current Version:_ 1.0.0 Beta
### Decription
This software should be used only to test websites you own or are permitted to work on.
I created it to search for all directories off of a given "root" directory.
I am sure it is not the fastest tool out there or the sneakiest. 
If you have a feature request open an issue and I will consider looking at implimenting it.


### *Task List*:

  - [x] validate inputs
  
  - [x] dictionary method

  - [x] add the ability to specify file extensions
  
  - [x] random user-agents
  
  - [ ] bruteforce method

  - [ ] ability to run over command line with arguments
  
  - [ ] /everything else/
